/** This class acts as a proxy for the simple screen reader.  It waits for
    two types of events:
    1. Accessibility events signal modifications concerning accessibility
       objects.
    2. Top window events inform the listener about new or removed windows.

    This class exists because events had to be handled in a seperate thread
    to avoid dead locks: The thread that receives an event must no call back
    to the Office directly.

    Soon this should not be necessary anymore.  There is now a flag which
    switches between synchronous and asynchronous callbacks.

    All reveived events are eventually forwarded to the actual listener.  In
    this way it decouples the Office from the listener.
