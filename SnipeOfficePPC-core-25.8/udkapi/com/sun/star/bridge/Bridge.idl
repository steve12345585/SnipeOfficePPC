        <li> arbitrary-module-path.ProtocolnameBridge </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The protocol name should be written as common servicenames, first letter is a
    capital letter, the rest in small letters postfixed by Bridge (e.g.:
    <code>com.sun.star.bridge.UrpBridge</code> would be correct servicename for the
    "urp" protocol).  However, the protocol names are compared case insensitive.
    If there exist two services supporting the same protocol, it is arbitrary
    which one is chosen, so this should be omitted. </p>
