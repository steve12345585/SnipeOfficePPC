		General Handling
		----------------

- The developer inserts the OpenOffice.org version into the @since tag.

- @since-Tag may contain any string which needs to end with a Version number.
  The first cipher following immediately on a white space is interpreted as start of the version number.

- The @since Tag must stay completely within one line to allow tool support for retargeting.

- To replace @since entries in the generated documentation, one needs to use
  the command line option

  -sincefile <TransformationFile-path>

  This option has to occur immediately after the -html option.
  If this option is not given, the original text of the @since tag is
  displayed.

  If the TransformationFile does not contain a specific entry,
  nothing is displayed for this entry.



		Format of the @since Tag Transformation File
		--------------------------------------------

Example
-------

***** BEGIN OF FILE ******
"1.1" "StarOffice 7.0"
"2.0" "StarOffice 8.0"
"2.1" "StarOffice 9.0"
