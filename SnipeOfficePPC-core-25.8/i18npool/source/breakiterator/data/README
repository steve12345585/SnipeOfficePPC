The originals of these come from svn checkout
http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/brkitr they no
longer appear in the icu tarballs, but are in icu's svn

At various stages these copies have been customized and are now horribly out of
sync. It unclear which diffs from the base versions are deliberate and which
are now accidental :-(

We need to review the various issues referenced in the commits that caused
customizations and see if they're still relevant or not, write regression tests
for them, if any are still relevant then apply the changes back on top of the
latest versions.
