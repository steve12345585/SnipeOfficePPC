            list box entry, for example), you might make it the current entry,
            if your implementation supports this - whatever.

            @param _pEntry
                the entry to select. This is the return value of a previous call
                to <member>FirstSearchEntry</member> or <member>NextSearchEntry</member>.

            Note: The semantics of "execute" depends on your implementation. You
            might even have a list of entries which cannot be executed at all.

            This method is called after <member>SelectSearchEntry</member>,
            if and only if the current entry's mnemonic is unambiguous.

            For instance, imagine a list which has two entries with the same mnemonic
            character, say "c". Now if the user presses <code>Alt-C</code>, the MnemonicEngine
            will call <member>SelectCurrentEntry</member> as soon as it encounters
            the first entry, but it'll never call <member>ExecuteSearchEntry</member>.

            If, however, "c" is a unique mnemonic character in your entry list, then the
            call of <member>SelectSearchEntry</member> will be followed by a
            call to <member>ExecuteSearchEntry</member>.

            This way, you can implement cyclic selection of entries: In
            <member>FirstSearchEntry</member>, return the entry which was previously
            selected, and in <member>NextSearchEntry</member>, interlly cycle around
            in your list. Then, multiple user inputs of <code>Alt-C</code> will
            cycle through all entries with the mnemonic being "c".

            @param _pEntry
                the entry to select. This is the return value of a previous call
                to <member>FirstSearchEntry</member> or <member>NextSearchEntry</member>.
