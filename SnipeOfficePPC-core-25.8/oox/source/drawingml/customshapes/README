This code is used to generate the customshapepresets source code.

To re-generate the code first you need to re-build oox with:

make oox.clean oox dbglevel=2

Then load the cshape-all.pptx file[1]

SAL_LOG='+INFO+WARN' ./soffice /path/to/oox/pptx/cshape-all.pptx 2>& | tee /path/to/oox/custom-shapes.log

Now run:

generatePresetsCXX.pl # this operates on custom-shapes.log in the CWD

And this will re-generate the .cxx sources we need to embed the right
custom shapes into the source code.

[1] - this file is built by generatePresetsPPTXs.pl incidentally.
