    <p>This service supports the additional <type

    interface.</p>

    <p>OLE objects are handled as place holders.  While not activated the
    accessible OLE shape is the only indicator of the OLE object's
    existence.  When an OLE object has been activated then the accessibility
    tree representing it (as far as that is available) is included directly
    under the accessible document view and not under the OLE object.  This
    is due to underlying implementation constraints and may change in the
    future.</p>
