        <p>Compatibility names are localized names of AddIn functions that
        are used to import files from other applications.</p>

        <p>If on import a localized function name is read, this list of
        compatibility names is used to find the internal name of the
        function. The current locale may differ from the locale used in
        the imported file, so the method
        <member>XAddIn::getProgrammaticFuntionName</member> cannot be used
        here.</p>

        <p>The order inside the sequence of compatibility names is used to
        prioritize the names. Initially the first compatibility name of
        each function is compared to the imported name (each function may
        provide a sequence of compatibility names - the first entry of all
        sequences is used). If no entry is equal, the second entry of each
        sequence is used and so on.</p>

        <p>If a locale is not present in the sequence of compatibility names,
        the first entry of the sequence is used. So the method should return
        a sequence which contains first the entry representing the current
        locale.<TRUE/></p>

        @param aProgrammaticName
            is the exact name of a method within its interface.
