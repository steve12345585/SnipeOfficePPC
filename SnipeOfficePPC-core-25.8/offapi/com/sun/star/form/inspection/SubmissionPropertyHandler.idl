/** implements a property handler for use with an <type scope="com::sun::star::inspection">ObjectInspector</type>
    which provides properties for button controls which support submission of XML forms.

    <p>The handler expects a value named "ContextDocument" in the context in which it is created.
    That is, the <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">XComponentContext</type> used for creating the
    <type>CellBindingPropertyHandler</type> is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this
    value denotes a XML form document (indicated by supporting the <type scope="com::sun::star::xforms">XFormsSupplier</type>
    interface), this document is used to examine the XML submissions which the button can be bound to.</p>
