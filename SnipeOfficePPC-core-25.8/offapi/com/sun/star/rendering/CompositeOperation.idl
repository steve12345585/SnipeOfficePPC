    When performing this calculations, it is assumed that all color
    values are premultiplied with the corresponding alpha values (if
    no alpha is specified, 1.0 is assumed). Then, the following

    different composite modes (wherein Aa and Ab denote source and
    destination alpha, respectively).<p>
