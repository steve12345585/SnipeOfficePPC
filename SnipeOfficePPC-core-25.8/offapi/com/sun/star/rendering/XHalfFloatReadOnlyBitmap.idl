/** Specialized interface for bitmaps containing half floats as their
    color components. Half floats are 16 bit wide, and some high-end
    GPUs already have them as supported frame buffer format. In
    contrast to <type>XHalfFloatBitmap</type>, this interface only
    permits read-only access.<p>

    Use this interface for e.g. bitmaps that are calculated
    on-the-fly, or that are pure functional, and thus cannot be
    modified.<p>

    If you get passed an instance of
    <type>XHalfFloatReadOnlyBitmap</type> that also supports the
    <type>XVolatileBitmap</type> interface, things become a bit more
    complicated. When reading data, one has to check for both
    <type>VolatileContentDestroyedException</type> and mismatching
    <type>FloatingPointBitmapLayout</type> return values. If either of them
    occurs, the whole bitmap read operation should be repeated.<p>
