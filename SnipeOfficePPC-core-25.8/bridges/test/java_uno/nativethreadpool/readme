Test that a Java URP bridge started in a native process uses the same thread
pool as a C++ URP bridge.  This test currently only works on Linux Intel.

There are two processes involved.  The client starts as a native process.  It
first loads a Java component (Relay) via the in-process JNI bridge, which in
turn starts to accept incomming URP connections.  The native part of the client
then connects to the server, retrieves a thread-local token from it, and checks
the token for correctness.  The server simply waits for a connection from the
native part of the client, creates a connection to the Java part of the client,
and routes all requests from the native part of the client to the Java part of
the client.  The Java part of the client in turn uses the in-process JNI bridge
to obtain the thread-local token.
