Obsolete dmake build tool.

The dmake build tool was for years the backbone of building the
codebase. Herein lies the bones of that effort - a patched, and fixed
up version of dmake that mostly works even on Windows.

It is now being incrementally written-out in favour of the faster
gnumake approach.
