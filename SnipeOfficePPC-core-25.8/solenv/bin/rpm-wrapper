# At least on v20z-so3, when /so/env/bt_linux_libc2.11/DEV300/bin/rpm is called
# and internally looks for a ld-linux.so.2, it picks up
# /lib/tls/i686/cmov/ld-linux.so.2 and SIGSEGVs.  This is prevented by
# adding /so/env/bt_linux_libc2.11/DEV300/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, thus
# picking up the ld-linux.so.2 from there:
