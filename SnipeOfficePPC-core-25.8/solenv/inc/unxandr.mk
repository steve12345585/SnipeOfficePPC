# We don't build any "tool" style programs for non-desktop OSes like
# Android. Just unit tests and GUI programs. (Well, that is in
# theory. In reality any actual "app" with a GUI for Android would be
# written and built in a totally Android-specific way, of course.)

# Thus for Android we never build executable programs, just shared
# libraries that the NativeActivity Java code will load.
