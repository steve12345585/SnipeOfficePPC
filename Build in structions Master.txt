Build Instructions:

1. Install Dependencies
   - Follow the instructions and install all required libraries and tools listed in the `dependancies` directory (e.g., zlib, libpng, etc.).
   - Make sure you have the correct versions for your platform (Mac OS X 10.5 PPC).

2. Run the Bootstrapper
   - This prepares the build system (downloads submodules, sets up scripts, etc.).
   - Command:
     ./bootstrap
   - or, if the script is named differently:
     ./bootstrap.sh

3. Run aclocal to set up m4 macros
   - This step ensures all required macros (like pkg.m4) are available for autoconf.
   - Command:
     aclocal -I m4
   - If you have a Darwin-specific directory, use:
     aclocal -I m4 -I m4/mac

4. Run Autoconf
   - This generates the `configure` script from `configure.in` or `configure.ac`.
   - Command:
     autoconf
   - or, for a more thorough regeneration:
     autoreconf -fi

5. Run Configure
   - This sets up the build environment for your system.
   - Command:

./configure --enable-macosx-sdk=10.5 --disable-windows-build -prefix=/usr/local --with-system-zlib


6. Build the Project
   - Start the build process:
     make MD5SUM= V=1 2>&1 | tee build.log
   - For parallel builds (faster on multi-core systems):
     make -j4

7. (Optional) Run Tests
   - To verify the build:
     make check
   - or
     make test

8. (Optional) Install
   - To install the built binaries:
     sudo make install

Note:
- If you update or replace any of the build system files (`configure.in`, `configure.ac`, `Makefile.am`, etc.), always re-run steps 2 and 3 before running `configure` again.
- If you encounter errors related to missing scripts or macros, ensure you have run both the bootstrap and aclocal steps before autoconf/autoreconf.
